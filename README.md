# VR-Sync
```yaml
VR-Sync v0.0.2
```
```diff
Function: Allows virtual reality movements to be synced to other players.
```
# Todo List
- [x] Sync head movements
- [x] Sync right hand movements
- [x] Sync left hand movements
- [x] Rig head movements
- [x] Rig right hand movements

```Right hand movements have been bound to the weapon.```
- [ ] Rig left hand movements

```Left hand movements have no weapon to be bound to.```

- [ ] Connect body to movements

```Phasmophobia method - Limit movements and attach the limbs to the body```
```VRChat method - Allow funky flexibility and make limbs move based on tracked limbs```

# Ideas
- Guns use PLPawnIK for hand movement, can this be tweaked to make hands move properly?
- Disable tracking for using turret (Head disappears currently)
- Disable head position tracking for Captains chair
